 - Module icon
   - Show 'connecting' animation
   - Show strength when available

 - Treat ReportError() calls from ConnMan. When a connection fail,
   ReportError() indicates the reason so we can decide if we should
   show a message to user asking the password again

 - Streamline the Cancel() and Release() callbacks because they are very
   similar

 - Destroy popup when we are going to ask for user input

 - When we request user input, give focus to the first 'Mandatory'
   entry field

 - Search for entries with the same type when we receive an
   'Informational' field so we can use it in an useful manner

 - Add "config" button in popup that will call the external binary for
   advanced configuration

 - Add configuration entry to set the external binary - econnman-bin is
   the default
